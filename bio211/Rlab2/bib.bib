abstract={In recent years an increasing number of studies on thermophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins aiming to elucidate determinants of protein thermostability have yielded valuable insights about the relevant mechanisms. In particular, comparison of homologous enzymes with different thermostabilities (isolated from psychrophilic, mesophilic, thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organsims) offers a unique opportunity to determine the strategies of thermal adaptation. In this respect, the medium-sized amylolytic enzyme α-amylase is a well-established representative. Various studies on α-amylases with very different thermostabilities (melting temperature T^sub m^ = 40-110°C) report structural and dynamical features as well as thermodynamical properties which are supposed to play key roles in thermal adaptation. Here, results from selected homologous α-amylases are presented and discussed with respect to some new and recently proposed strategies to achieve thermostability.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={A fragment coding for a putative extracellular alpha]-amylase, from the genomic library of the yeast Saccharomycopsis fibuligera KZ, has been subcloned into yeast expression vector pVT100L and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence revealed an ORF of 1,485 bp coding for a 494 amino acid residues long protein with 99% identity to the alpha]-amylase Sfamy from S. fibuligera HUT 7212. The S. fibuligera KZ alpha]-amylase (Sfamy KZ) belongs to typical extracellular fungal alpha]-amylases classified in the glycoside hydrolase family 13, subfamily 1, as supported also by clustering observed in the evolutionary tree. Sfamy KZ, in addition to the essential GH13 alpha]-amylase three-domain arrangement (catalytic TIM barrel plus domains B and C), does not contain any distinct starch-binding domain. Sfamy KZ was expressed as a recombinant protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The enzyme had a molecular mass 53 kDa and contained about 2.5% of carbohydrate. The enzyme exhibited pH and temperature optima in the range of 5-6 and 40-50 degrees C, respectively. Stable adsorption of the enzyme to starch granules was not detected but a low degradation of raw starch in a concentration-dependent manner was observed. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},
