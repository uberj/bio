pg. 184 - If autotrophs are "self-feeders" and most plants are "photoautotrophs", then what is an example of a pure "autotroph".

Heterotrophs - 'hetero' meaning other, these organisms get energy from sources other than themselves (like eating stuff)

pg. 186 - H_2O is a product of photosynthesis, yet it is also an input. Niel's hypothesis was confirmed when O^18 was used as a tracer in photosynthesis and showed that H_2O with the tracer produced O_2 with the tracer, but C0_2 with the tracer did not produce O_2 with the tracer. How can this be? All input oxygen (either H_20 or CO_2) gets turned into water, which eventually is an input?

Possible answer in the question of: what happens to the product H_20, is it recycled as an input?

pg. 194 - Step 5, chemiosmosis occurs but ATP synthase is not mentioned. What is making the ATP?
