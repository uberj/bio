Chapter 10
==========
* pg. 184 - If autotrophs are "self-feeders" and most plants are "photoautotrophs", then what is an example of a pure "autotroph".

* Heterotrophs - 'hetero' meaning other, these organisms get energy from sources other than themselves (like eating stuff)

* pg. 186 - H_2O is a product of photosynthesis, yet it is also an input. Niel's hypothesis was confirmed when O^18 was used as a tracer in photosynthesis and showed that H_2O with the tracer produced O_2 with the tracer, but C0_2 with the tracer did not produce O_2 with the tracer. How can this be? All input oxygen (either H_20 or CO_2) gets turned into water, which eventually is an input?
    - Possible answer in the question of: what happens to the product H_20, is it recycled as an input?

* pg. 194 - Step 5, chemiosmosis occurs but ATP synthase is not mentioned. What is making the ATP?
  - pg. 196 - ATP Synthase is involved


Chapter 10
==========
* pg 209 - Why do they not use the term ligand?
    - pg 210 - they reintroduce and start using the term ligand
* pg 209 - "The gazelle in Figure 11.1 is clearly engaged in the latter." -- the first joke I've read in this book
* pg 209 - How are transduction pathways determined?

Chapter 13
==========
* pg 249 - A gene's specific location along the length of a chromosome is called the gene's locus. What is a "gene"? If it is the thing that is expressed, how can it be located in one location?

Concept Check 13.2 - pg. 523
----------------------------
1. 12

2. chromosomes pairs are halved during the second phase of miosis, so the resulting sex cells have half the DNA

3. haploid number = 14
   diploid number = 7

   - Wrong. haploid is 7 and diploid is 14

4. fungi and some protist
