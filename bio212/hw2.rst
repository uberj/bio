Peppered Moths (Biston betularia) are a good example of natural selection because their gene pool seemed to be directly effected by man made changes in the environment. They are also a good example due to the fact that people were able to study both the rise and fall of certain phenotypes in their population in multiple geographic populations.

Several dark and light morphs (a certain phenotype) of pepper moths exist. The type relevant to this homework include dark and birch white. In peppered moths, the allele for dark-bodied moths is dominant.

In 19th century england, light colored pepper moths were abundant between the cities of London an Manchester. These light colored moths used the light colored birch trees as camouflage to hide from predators. During the industrial revolution suit from coal burning factories built up on the white birch trees. The non-melanic (white) peppered moths could no longer use these trees as camouflage when hiding from predators and they were easy targets for hungry predators. This environmental disadvantage caused a reduction in their ability to reproduce and pass a white-color allele to offspring.

The melanic (dark colored) population, on the other hand, was able to leverage these suit covered birch trees as more effective cover from predators. These moths saw their reproductive fitness increase and were more likely to pass along their dark-color allele to their offspring.

Natural selection is how certain genes become more (or less) frequent in a population due to environmental pressures that reward (or punish) a gene by allowing individuals to have more (or less) success producing offspring. It is thought that natural selection and not genetic drift is responsible for the changes allele frequency in the population of peppered moths.
