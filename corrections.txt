Question 60:
Water is cohesively held together by hydrogen bonds. These bonds act as little
energy buffers when heat is added to water which helps keep a volume's average
kinetic energy, or temperature, low. The ability to take in heat like this means
that water has a relatively high specific heat (meaning it takes a relatively
large amount of heat to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree C).

As water molecules evaporate (which occurs at all temperatures) water molecules
leave a volume of water, breaking their hydrogen bonds. The energy that a
molecule uses to break its hydrogen bond lowers the average kinetic energy of a
volume of water, thus lowering the temperature of the water -- this phenomena is
called evaporative cooling. The amount of energy needed to break a hydrogen bond
(which is required for evaporative cooling to occur) is called the 'heat of
vaporization' and for water is a high amount of energy compared to other
molecules.

---------------------------

Question 12:
    Wrong Answer: (B) a van der Waals interaction
    Right Answer: (D) a hydrogen bond
    Reason: Partial negative and positive charges due to oxygen's high
        electronegativity cause hydrogen bonds. Though van der Waals interaction
        happen between dipoles (and water *is* a dipole molecule) this was not the
        'most correct' answer.


Question 18:
    Wrong Answer: (E) Dissolve 0.5g of gluecose in 1 L of water
    Right Answer: (D) Dissolve 90g of glucose in a small volume of water, and
        then add more water until the total volume of the solution is 1L
    Reason:

        180g            (180/2)g       90g
        ----  =  1M     -------   =  ------ = 0.5M
         1L                1L          1L

Question 20:
    Wrong Answer: (B) 10^-6 M
    Right Answer: (E) 10^-6 M
    Reason:
        -log(x) = 8       (solve for x)
        -log(10^8) = 8


Question 21:
    Wrong Answer: (C) 100,000 times more
    Right Answer: (D) 10,000 times more
    Reason:
        6pH - 4pH = 4pH
        1.0000 * (4 * 10) = 10,000

Question 40:
    Wrong Answer: (E) all of the above
    Right Answer: (D) tertiary
    Reason:
        "Most important" is asking for one, I guess.

Question 41:
    Wrong Answer: (D) hydrogen bonds between the R groups
    Right Answer: ( ) hydrogen bonds between the amino group of one peptide bond
        and the carboxyl group of another peptide bond
    Reason:
        Page 82 of the textbook shows this.
